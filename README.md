# imageclassification
Image classification using PCA and LDA

Converting Images into Numpy Array and storing images into traing (80%) and testing (20%) matrics

Centering Images(trainingset)

Scalling Images (TrainingSet)

Finding Co-variance of the training matrix
Applying SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and getting 
From U to Ureduced
Reconstructing of X (as Z) using Ureduced and different values of k when k<n

Testing accuracy with different K
